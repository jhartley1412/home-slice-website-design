Inspirational sites 
--------------------

https://www.dominos.com/en/
	Not only is it a fellow pizza joint, I've always thought Dominos has had a strong graphic design team (both in brand and overall presence). They have a good mix of humor and functionality.

	Another pizza site, this one is clean, easy to read, and uses a tantalizing color combo of red and green (that isn't christmassy, but actually makes you kind of hungry), I also like that it's mostly centered 

	EDIT: since their website redesign (some time in March?), some of what I've initially written is not longer valid. However, their over cleanness is still apparent. So is that fact that some of the elements are center aligned. I also like how much white space their site is now; it's much more breathable. This site is staying as one of my sites for inspiration, but for a few different reasons than before.

	Yet another pizza place, although I don't love long pages you have to scroll down to, I do love the grittiness and "streets"-style of the site, and will probably add a sense of "young culture" into Home Slice's website 

http://www.vertskebap.com/nutrition/
	Specifically I do like how, on the Nutrition and About pages, they have a banner of their ingredients laid out on white

http://www.bk.com
	I like that they have big, in your face font sizes, and, like most of the other sites, big res images of their food

	Sites like these, that are centered, always are visually comforting to me. I like the organization, and how easy it is to scroll down the pages.

http://www.pandora.com
	I like how pandora has a fixed min-width (isn't responsive). It's a simple radio site, and almost reminds me of a control panel for music. I also just noticed that whichever album cover you're currently listening to is centered to the middle of the screen (roughly). It's no more complicated than it needs to be.

	This site (minus the parallax scrolling) is a lot like what I’m trying to do as well. Fill the screen with information and color, but also be toned down enough so that it’s not distracting as much as blended in. I worry though how image heavy these sites are compared to what I’m able to get online.
