	Not only is it a fellow pizza joint, I've always thought Dominos has had a strong graphic design team (both in brand and overall presence). They have a good mix of humor and functionability.

	Another pizza site, this one is clean, easy to read, and uses a tantalizing color combo of red and green (that isn't christmassy, but actually makes you kind of hungry), I also like that it's mostly centered 

https://www.toppers.com
	Yet another pizza place, although I don't love long pages you have to scroll down to, I do love the grittiness and "streets"-style of the site, and will probably add a sense of "young culture" into Home Slice's website

http://www.bk.com
