Home Slice Pizza

Strengths
	- lots of foot traffic / popular location
	- one of the only "NY style" pizza places in Austin
	- "family owned / started"
	- friendly staff ("home away from home")
	- are an establishment that hosts parties and events



Weaknesses
	- most other Austin pizzeria's share similar aesthetics
	- busy traffic = long lines, people going elsewhere
	- being a company that promotes "family," and also seems to target a "younger crowd" (they're To-Go building was mostly young adults ordering beers and wine)â€”some confusion over their target market




Oppertunities
	- (thanks to third parties like favor) they deliver
	- have a lot of events / bring in extra people
	- being a popoular, neighboorhood centric establishment (so they seem), means lots of returning customers



Threats
	- most other Austin pizzeria's share similar aesthetics
